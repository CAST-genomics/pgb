Awesome—here’s the whole concept, end-to-end, written the way a rendering engineer would want it. I’ll stick to your vocabulary:

* **Node**: the drawable thing (a `ParametricLine` with \~32 verts)
* **Node Run**: maximal chain of abutting **Interior Nodes (deg=2)** bounded by **Junction Nodes (deg≠2)** or forming a closed loop
* **Rendered Line**: the single `ParametricLine` made by concatenating a Node Run
* **Component**: a connected set of Nodes (edges only used for traversal, never drawn)
* **Pixel Run**: a contiguous interval on a Rendered Line that spans at least *p* pixels at the current zoom (the LOD bin)

Below is the pipeline, with special focus on how LOD updates as you zoom.

# 1) Ingest & normalize

1. **Load Nodes** with their \~32 control vertices (world space) and a `bp` length per Node (basepairs).
2. **Load Edges** only to build an undirected adjacency; they won’t be drawn.

Sanity checks:

* Every Node has a sensible `bp` (≥0).
* Vertices are in a consistent winding (start→end), or you’re OK to flip for stitching.

# 2) Build Components (connectivity)

* Use the Edges to compute connected components.
* Store each **Component** as just a `Set<nodeId>`; no geometry yet.

Why: Components are your “load units.” You’re not doing quadtree/screen tiling, so this is the only grouping you need.

# 3) Discover **Node Runs** (degree-2 chains)

Goal: collapse long strings of straight-through Nodes (deg=2) into fewer, bigger things to draw.

For each Component:

1. Compute degree for every Node from the adjacency.
2. **From every Junction Node (deg≠2)**, walk along neighbors through Interior Nodes until you reach the next Junction/Tip → that chain is one **Node Run**.
3. Any leftover deg=2 Nodes belong to **closed loops**; walk until you return to the seed → another Node Run with `closed=true`.

Result: a list of Node Runs, each an ordered list of `nodeId`s.

# 4) Concatenate each Node Run → **Rendered Line**

We’re going to stitch all Nodes in a Run into one `ParametricLine`.

Stitching rules:

* Start with the first Node’s vertices “as is”.
* For each subsequent Node, choose orientation so the **nearest endpoint** matches the previous endpoint; if needed, reverse its 32 vertices.
* When appending, **drop the seam vertex** if it’s coincident (avoid duplicate).
* Accumulate per-Node `Δbp` to build a **cumulative bp table** at Node boundaries (`bpStart/bpEnd`).
* Build a **Run Index** mapping each original Node to its `[t0,t1]` on the final Rendered Line (you get `t` from arc-length normalization along the concatenated vertices).

Tiny pseudo:

```js
// per Node Run
points = seedNode.points.clone();
for each nextNode in run:
  orient to meet prevEnd; append, skipping seam
normalize arc length → tAtVert[]
runIndex = [{ nodeId, t0, t1, bpStart, bpEnd }, ...]
renderedLine = new ParametricLine(points, { closed })
```

Why arc-length? Your `ParametricLine` is already param’d 0→1; we want `t` to reflect distance along the Rendered Line for stable sampling, picking, and LOD bins.

# 5) Ortho pixel scale (only on zoom/resize)

With an orthographic camera, pixel scale is global and simple:

* Get drawing buffer size (physical px): `Wpx, Hpx`
* Effective world extents:
  `Wworld = (right - left)/zoom`, `Hworld = (top - bottom)/zoom`
* Pixels per world unit:
  `Sx = Wpx / Wworld`, `Sy = Hpx / Hworld`

These change only when zoom or viewport changes (panning does not).

# 6) Per-Rendered Line **Cpx** (cumulative pixel length)

On each zoom/resize:

1. Transform Rendered Line vertices into **camera view space** (x,y) using `camera.matrixWorldInverse * object.matrixWorld`.
2. For each segment `i→i+1`:
   `Δpx = hypot((Δx*Sx), (Δy*Sy))`
3. Accumulate to **Cpx** (same length as the vertex array).

This gives you a precise mapping from *along-line position* to *on-screen pixels* at the current zoom.

# 7) LOD with **Pixel Runs** (the heart of it)

We define a minimum on-screen span `p_min` (e.g., 1.0–2.0 px). Any detail smaller than that merges into its neighbors.

For each Rendered Line:

1. Walk vertices from left→right (in `t` order), accumulating pixel length via `Cpx`.
2. When the span since the last bin edge reaches `p_min`, **close a Pixel Run**: `[t0, t1]`, `pxSpan`, and compute `bpSpan` by intersecting with your **Run Index** (so tooltips/stats remain bp-aware).
3. Continue until the end.

What happens visually:

* When zoomed out, tons of tiny Nodes collapse into a few Pixel Runs.
* As you zoom in (pixel scale grows), each bin eventually exceeds `p_min` and **splits** into multiple bins, gradually revealing fine detail.

## Keeping LOD stable as you zoom

You don’t want bins to flicker as you cross the 1 px threshold back and forth. Use **hysteresis**:

* Split a bin only if it grows beyond **`p_split = 1.25 * p_min`**.
* Merge adjacent bins only if their combined span drops below **`p_merge = 0.8 * p_min`**.

This creates a dead-band that prevents thrashing near the threshold.

## When to recompute

* Recompute `Cpx` and re-bin Pixel Runs **only** when:

  * `camera.zoom` changes (or the canvas is resized), or
  * the Rendered Line’s model matrix changes.

You can **throttle** re-binning to zoom deltas (e.g., only when zoom changes by ≥2%) for even more stability.

## Two common LOD strategies

* **Dynamic (on-the-fly)**: recompute Pixel Runs each zoom change. Simple, responsive, scales well.
* **Cached bands**: precompute a small set of Pixel Run sets for zoom “bands” (e.g., every factor of √2 in scale), then pick the nearest and **cross-fade**. Handy if you also bake color into a 1D LUT texture (see below). Dynamic is usually enough.

# 8) Coloring & annotations across LOD

You have two clean options; both avoid a big scene graph.

**A) Shader sampling via a 1D LUT**

* Build a fixed-width `DataTexture1D` per Rendered Line that encodes color (or other scalar) as a function of `t`.
* On zoom, you can **re-rasterize** the LUT from the current Pixel Runs, or switch between cached bands.
* The fragment shader samples `texture(lut, t)`—one texture fetch per pixel. Perfect for “show me depth/frequency/coverage along the line.”

**B) Instanced glyphs for runs**

* Use Pixel Runs to place **instanced capsules** (rounded rects) or dots. Each instance carries `(t0, t1, type, importance)`.
* The vertex shader expands the capsule in **screen space** so it stays crisp regardless of world scale.
* This is great for “pills/bubbles” marking interesting regions without overpainting the ribbon.

You can mix both: color the ribbon from a LUT and overlay sparse instanced pills for salience.

# 9) Picking that respects LOD

* Raycast the Rendered Line (you already have `ParametricLine: xyz↔t`).
* Once you have `t_hit`:

  * Find the **Pixel Run** that contains `t_hit` → you get `pxSpan`, `bpSpan`, and a **nodeId subset**.
  * If the run covers many tiny Nodes, your tooltip can say “Merged 7 nodes, 154 bp” with an option to “zoom here to split.”

For “exact Node” reporting:

* Intersect `t_hit` with the **Run Index** (`[{nodeId, t0, t1, bpStart, bpEnd}]`), no matter the current LOD, and report the specific Node if the user is zoomed in enough; otherwise report the aggregated bin.

# 10) Draw calls & buffers (practical)

* Start simple: **one draw per Rendered Line** (one `ParametricLine` each).
* If that’s too many, batch many Rendered Lines into one geometry and carry a `pathId/breakFlag` attribute to reset joins in the material.
* Keep vertex buffers **persistent**; you aren’t editing vertices when LOD changes—only colors/instances/LUTs.

# 11) Performance knobs that matter

* **Screen-space decimation**: after concatenation, decimate vertices with a target screen-space error (e.g., 0.5 px). Do this per zoom band once, or dynamically if you want, but even a single modest decimation will help huge datasets.
* **Throttle LOD updates**: only re-bin when zoom changes by ≥2% (or on `requestAnimationFrame` if a zoom gesture is active).
* **Double-buffer LUTs**: update into a spare texture, then swap; avoids GPU stalls.
* **Typed arrays**: hold `tAtVert`, `Cpx`, `runIndex` in `Float32Array/Float64Array` for cache-friendly math.

# 12) Edge cases & robustness

* **Closed loops**: if `closed=true`, either pass that to your `ParametricLine` or accept a tiny seam; Pixel Runs work the same (wrap around).
* **Zero-length segments**: if two consecutive points collapse in view space, `Δpx=0`. The small epsilon in divisions prevents NaNs; bins will just merge immediately.
* **Self-crossings**: irrelevant for LOD—binning is along-path, not image density.
* **Huge bp in tiny pixels**: cap `bp/px` in UI to something sane; the binning already reduces that region to a single run.

# 13) Putting it together (render loop)

* On load: build Components → Node Runs → Rendered Lines + Run Index.
* On **zoom/resize**:

  1. compute `Sx,Sy`
  2. for each visible Rendered Line: recompute `Cpx` → rebuild **Pixel Runs** (with hysteresis) → update LUT or instances
  3. render

Tiny sketch:

```js
function onZoomOrResize() {
  const { Sx, Sy } = orthoScales(camera, renderer); // global
  for (const rl of renderedLinesVisible) {
    rl.Cpx = computeCpx(rl, object3D, camera, renderer); // view-space → pixels
    rl.pixelRuns = rebuildPixelRuns(rl, rl.Cpx, pMinPx, hysteresis);
    // update LUT or instance buffer from rl.pixelRuns
  }
}
```

# 14) Why this LOD feels good in practice

* It’s **view-coupled**: decisions are made in pixel space, so what you see is always scaled correctly for the current zoom.
* It’s **stable**: hysteresis eliminates flicker when you hover near thresholds.
* It’s **cheap**: you never touch the heavy vertex buffers during zoom; you just recompute `Cpx` (fast) and rebuild small per-line run lists or a tiny LUT.

If you want, I can add a micro-demo outline next: a single Rendered Line, a live readout of `bp/px` under the cursor, and a toggle to show Pixel Runs splitting/merging as you mouse-wheel zoom.
